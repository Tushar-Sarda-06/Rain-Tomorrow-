Developed an ML model for rainfall prediction using historical data for meteorologistsâ€™ forecasting
Conducted EDA using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to identify key correlations in the data.
 Implemented OneHotEncoder and MinMaxScaler to preprocess 145K+ records covering 11 years.
Addressed class imbalance using a confusion matrix, reducing Type I error to 4%, and optimized 
LogisticRegression to achieve 85.4% accuracy, identifying WindGustSpeed, Humidity3PM as key predictors.
